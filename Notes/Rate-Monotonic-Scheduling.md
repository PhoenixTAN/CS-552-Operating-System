# Rate Monotonic Scheduling
rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS)[1] is a priority assignment algorithm used in real-time operating systems (RTOS) with a static-priority scheduling class.[2] The static priorities are assigned according to the cycle duration of the job, so a shorter cycle duration results in a higher job priority.
